# Wicked Space Flight

Wicked Space Flight is an example project for the wicked engine

## Using CMAKE
### Requirements
Wicked Engine built with cmake somewhere in your system (does not matter where).
The build folder is going to be important in the next step.

### Build
```sh
$ cmake -B build -DWickedEngine_DIR=/path/to/wicked/build_folder/cmake .
$ cmake --build build -j8
```

## Using Microsoft Solution Files
At the moment it's not supported.
Need some help in how to make this because I don't know.
